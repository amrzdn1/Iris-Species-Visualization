# Iris Species Visualization Project

This repository hosts a Python Jupyter Notebook project developed during a TECHNOHACKS EDUTECH internship. The project aims to visualize data for classifying Iris species utilizing the seaborn and matplotlib libraries.

## Overview

The primary objective of this project is to conduct a visual analysis of the Iris dataset, classifying different species of Iris flowers. Preceding the visualization, rigorous data cleaning procedures were applied to ensure the dataset was devoid of null values, duplicates, and missing data.

## Tools Used

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib

## Project Structure

- `Iris_Species_Visualization.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing Python code for data cleaning, visualization, and classification of Iris species.
- `iris_dataset.csv`: Dataset utilized for analysis, meticulously cleaned to eliminate nulls, duplicates, and missing data.

## Instructions

To execute the project:

1. Verify that Python is installed on your system.
2. Install the necessary libraries by executing `pip install seaborn matplotlib` in your command line interface.
3. Clone this repository to your local machine.
4. Launch `Iris_Species_Visualization.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.
5. Follow the instructions and execute the cells to run the code and visualize the Iris species classification.

Feel free to explore and adapt the code to suit your requirements!
